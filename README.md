# 🩻 Shoulder X-ray Rehabilitation

This project focuses on **analyzing and classifying shoulder X-ray images** to support rehabilitation processes. Using deep learning techniques, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing initial assessments based on medical imaging.

## 📋 Project Description

Shoulder injuries and disorders are among the most common musculoskeletal problems. This project leverages **machine learning** and **deep learning** to automate the analysis of shoulder X-ray images, aiming to:
- Classify shoulder X-rays into different injury types.
- Support medical diagnosis and rehabilitation decision-making.
- Reduce time and effort for healthcare providers.

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessing and augmentation of X-ray datasets.
- Model training and evaluation using deep learning architectures.
- Performance metrics (accuracy, loss curves, etc.).
- Easy to extend for other medical imaging tasks.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
